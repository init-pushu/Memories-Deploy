# College Memories


While the purpose of college is to get an education, it is also a unique and unforgettable time, with memories that will last for a lifetime. As you leave that school life behind, you're probably carrying much more around than just a shiny new diploma. Most students in their final year have many memories of college life. This site is on college memories which will help you summarise your experience on campus in a few words.

Good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.
